Vanilla JS - ToDo List app

This is a basic todo list app that was created using HTML, CSS and vanilla js.

It lets an user do the following:
- Add tasks to the list
- Check the tasks and mark them as completed when done
- Uncheck the tasks if checked in error
- Remove tasks from the list completely if no longer needed to be done

It also saves the data to a local storage and keeps the data persistent even after browser close or refresh.

Deployment: Deployed and setup the website using vercel
